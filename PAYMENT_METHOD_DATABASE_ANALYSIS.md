# Payment Method Database Analysis

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the payment method system in the database, covering schema design, relationships, security policies, and implementation details.

---

## Database Schema

### Table: `payment_methods`

**Created in Migration:** `20250901125510_floating_sky.sql`
**Enhanced in Migration:** `20250109000000_add_merchants.sql` (Multi-merchant support)

#### Column Structure

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | `text` | PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier in kebab-case format (e.g., 'gcash', 'maya', 'bank-transfer') |
| `name` | `text` | NOT NULL | Display name shown to customers (e.g., 'GCash', 'Maya (PayMaya)') |
| `account_number` | `text` | NOT NULL | Phone number or account number for receiving payments |
| `account_name` | `text` | NOT NULL | Name of the account holder |
| `qr_code_url` | `text` | NOT NULL | URL to the QR code image stored in Cloudinary |
| `active` | `boolean` | DEFAULT true | Whether the payment method is currently available |
| `sort_order` | `integer` | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0 | Controls display order in checkout (lower = first) |
| `merchant_id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL, FK ‚Üí merchants(id) | Links payment method to specific merchant |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | DEFAULT now() | Timestamp of creation |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | DEFAULT now() | Auto-updated timestamp |

#### Key Features

1. **Text-based Primary Key**: Uses human-readable IDs instead of UUIDs for easier reference in code
2. **QR Code Support**: Each payment method includes a QR code image for customer convenience
3. **Active/Inactive Toggle**: Allows temporary disabling without deletion
4. **Sort Order**: Enables customizable ordering in the checkout interface
5. **Multi-merchant Support**: Each merchant can have their own payment methods

---

## Database Indexes

```sql
-- For merchant-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_methods_merchant_id ON payment_methods(merchant_id);
```

**Purpose:** Optimizes queries filtering payment methods by merchant, crucial for multi-merchant marketplace functionality.

---

## Database Triggers

### Auto-Update Timestamp

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_payment_methods_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON payment_methods
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

**Purpose:** Automatically updates the `updated_at` timestamp whenever a record is modified.

---

## Row-Level Security (RLS)

### RLS is Enabled
```sql
ALTER TABLE payment_methods ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Security Policies

#### 1. Public Read Access (Active Methods Only)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read active payment methods"
  ON payment_methods
  FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING (active = true);
```

**Purpose:** 
- Allows unauthenticated customers to view only active payment methods
- Protects inactive/disabled methods from public view
- Ensures checkout page only shows available options

#### 2. Admin Full Access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage payment methods"
  ON payment_methods
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

**Purpose:**
- Grants full CRUD permissions to authenticated users (admins)
- Allows managing all payment methods regardless of active status
- Enables adding, editing, deleting, and reordering payment methods

**Security Consideration:** This assumes all authenticated users are admins. For production, consider more granular role-based access control.

---

## Default Data

### Initial Payment Methods
The system comes pre-configured with three popular Filipino payment methods:

```sql
INSERT INTO payment_methods (id, name, account_number, account_name, qr_code_url, sort_order, active) VALUES
  ('gcash', 'GCash', '09XX XXX XXXX', 'M&C Bakehouse', '[cloudinary-url]', 1, true),
  ('maya', 'Maya (PayMaya)', '09XX XXX XXXX', 'M&C Bakehouse', '[cloudinary-url]', 2, true),
  ('bank-transfer', 'Bank Transfer', 'Account: 1234-5678-9012', 'M&C Bakehouse', '[cloudinary-url]', 3, true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

**Note:** These are template values meant to be updated with actual merchant account details.

---

## Relationships

### Foreign Key Relationships

```
payment_methods.merchant_id ‚Üí merchants.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)
```

**Behavior:**
- Each payment method belongs to exactly one merchant
- When a merchant is deleted, all their payment methods are automatically deleted
- Enables merchant-specific payment configurations

### Referenced By

```
orders.payment_method (text field, no FK constraint)
```

**Important:** The `orders` table stores `payment_method` as a text field without a foreign key constraint. This means:
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility:** Orders retain payment method info even if the method is later deleted
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Referential Integrity:** No database-level validation that payment method exists
- üí° **Best Practice:** Application-level validation is required to ensure valid payment methods at order creation

---

## Multi-Merchant Implementation

### Evolution
The payment methods table was enhanced to support multiple merchants in the `20250109000000_add_merchants.sql` migration.

### Key Changes
1. Added `merchant_id` column with foreign key to `merchants` table
2. Created index for efficient merchant-based queries
3. Migrated existing payment methods to default merchant
4. Made `merchant_id` NOT NULL after migration

### Merchant Payment Method Configuration

Merchants have two ways to configure payment methods:

#### 1. Individual Payment Methods (Current Implementation)
- Each merchant has separate payment method records in `payment_methods` table
- Fully customizable QR codes, account numbers, and account names per merchant
- Complete isolation between merchants

#### 2. Accepted Payment Types (In Merchants Table)
```sql
payment_methods text[] -- Array in merchants table
```
- The `merchants` table also has a `payment_methods` column (text array)
- This appears to be for storing accepted payment types (e.g., ['gcash', 'maya', 'cash'])
- **Potential Confusion:** Two payment method systems exist

**Recommendation:** Clarify the distinction or consolidate these approaches for consistency.

---

## Frontend Implementation

### TypeScript Interface
```typescript
export interface PaymentMethod {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  account_number: string;
  account_name: string;
  qr_code_url: string;
  active: boolean;
  sort_order: number;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

**Note:** The interface doesn't include `merchant_id`, which may cause TypeScript issues when working with merchant-specific payment methods.

### Hook: `usePaymentMethods`

**Location:** `src/hooks/usePaymentMethods.ts`

**Key Functions:**

1. **fetchPaymentMethods()** - Fetches only active payment methods (for customers)
2. **fetchAllPaymentMethods()** - Fetches all payment methods (for admin)
3. **addPaymentMethod()** - Creates new payment method
4. **updatePaymentMethod()** - Updates existing payment method
5. **deletePaymentMethod()** - Permanently deletes payment method
6. **reorderPaymentMethods()** - Updates sort_order for all methods

**Current Limitation:** Does not filter by `merchant_id`, which is required for multi-merchant functionality.

### Component: `PaymentMethodManager`

**Location:** `src/components/PaymentMethodManager.tsx`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ CRUD operations for payment methods
- ‚úÖ Image upload integration via Cloudinary
- ‚úÖ Active/inactive toggle
- ‚úÖ Sort order management
- ‚úÖ ID auto-generation from name (kebab-case)
- ‚úÖ Validation for ID format and required fields
- ‚ùå No merchant filtering (shows all merchants' payment methods to all admins)

---

## Integration with Orders

### Order Creation Flow

1. **Customer selects payment method** in checkout (`Checkout.tsx`)
2. **Payment method ID stored** in `orders.payment_method` as text
3. **No FK constraint** - historical record preserved even if method deleted

### Checkout Implementation
```typescript
const { paymentMethods } = usePaymentMethods(); // Fetches active methods only
const [paymentMethod, setPaymentMethod] = useState<PaymentMethod>('gcash');
const selectedPaymentMethod = paymentMethods.find(method => method.id === paymentMethod);
```

**Display in Checkout:**
- Shows QR code image
- Displays account number and account name
- Customer can select from active payment methods only

---

## Issues & Recommendations

### üî¥ Critical Issues

#### 1. Missing Merchant Filtering
**Problem:** Payment methods are not filtered by merchant ID in the frontend
**Impact:** 
- Admin sees all merchants' payment methods
- Checkout might show wrong merchant's payment methods
- Data integrity risk in multi-merchant environment

**Solution:**
```typescript
// In usePaymentMethods hook
const fetchPaymentMethods = async (merchantId?: string) => {
  let query = supabase
    .from('payment_methods')
    .select('*')
    .eq('active', true);
  
  if (merchantId) {
    query = query.eq('merchant_id', merchantId);
  }
  
  const { data, error } = await query.order('sort_order', { ascending: true });
  // ...
};
```

#### 2. TypeScript Interface Missing merchant_id
**Problem:** PaymentMethod interface doesn't include merchant_id field
**Impact:** TypeScript doesn't enforce merchant_id handling

**Solution:**
```typescript
export interface PaymentMethod {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  account_number: string;
  account_name: string;
  qr_code_url: string;
  active: boolean;
  sort_order: number;
  merchant_id: string; // Add this
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

#### 3. Dual Payment Method Systems
**Problem:** Both `payment_methods` table and `merchants.payment_methods` column exist
**Impact:** Confusion about which to use, potential inconsistencies

**Solution:** Choose one approach:
- **Option A:** Use `payment_methods` table only (recommended for detailed config)
- **Option B:** Use `merchants.payment_methods` array only (simpler but less flexible)
- **Option C:** Keep both but clarify: `merchants.payment_methods` = accepted types, `payment_methods` table = detailed configurations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Concerns

#### 1. Overly Permissive Admin Policy
**Current:** All authenticated users can manage all payment methods
**Risk:** No role-based access control

**Recommendation:** Implement role-based policies:
```sql
-- Example: Check if user is admin
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can manage payment methods"
  ON payment_methods
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

#### 2. No Foreign Key to orders.payment_method
**Current:** Text field without referential integrity
**Risk:** Can't prevent deletion of payment method still in use

**Recommendation:** Either:
- Add FK constraint (prevents deletion)
- Or keep current design but add application-level checks before deletion

### üìù Data Quality Issues

#### 1. Placeholder Data in Production
**Issue:** Default payment methods have placeholder values ('09XX XXX XXXX')
**Risk:** Customers might see and attempt to use invalid payment information

**Recommendation:** 
- Remove or deactivate placeholder methods
- Provide admin UI prompt to configure real payment methods on first login
- Add validation to prevent activation with placeholder data

### üîß Optimization Opportunities

#### 1. Inefficient Reordering
**Current:** Sequential updates in a loop
```typescript
for (const update of updates) {
  await supabase
    .from('payment_methods')
    .update({ sort_order: update.sort_order })
    .eq('id', update.id);
}
```

**Better:** Use upsert with multiple records or a stored procedure for atomic updates

#### 2. Missing Composite Indexes
**Recommended:**
```sql
-- For merchant-specific active payment methods (most common query)
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_methods_merchant_active 
  ON payment_methods(merchant_id, active, sort_order);
```

---

## Best Practices Being Followed

‚úÖ **Text-based IDs** - Human-readable, predictable identifiers
‚úÖ **Soft Delete Alternative** - Active/inactive toggle instead of hard delete
‚úÖ **Timestamp Tracking** - Automatic created_at and updated_at
‚úÖ **RLS Enabled** - Security policies enforce access control
‚úÖ **Cascading Deletes** - Merchant deletion cleans up payment methods
‚úÖ **Indexed Foreign Keys** - Optimized merchant queries
‚úÖ **QR Code Integration** - Modern payment experience
‚úÖ **Sort Order** - Customizable display order
‚úÖ **Image URL Storage** - Leverages Cloudinary for image management

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Database Tests
1. **RLS Policies**
   - Verify public can only see active payment methods
   - Verify authenticated users can manage all methods
   - Test merchant-specific filtering

2. **Cascading Deletes**
   - Delete a merchant and verify payment methods are removed
   - Verify orders are not affected

3. **Constraints**
   - Try inserting duplicate IDs
   - Try inserting without required fields
   - Verify sort_order accepts only integers

### Application Tests
1. **Checkout Integration**
   - Verify only active methods appear
   - Test payment method selection
   - Verify QR code display

2. **Admin Management**
   - Test CRUD operations
   - Test reordering
   - Test image upload
   - Test ID validation (kebab-case)

3. **Multi-merchant Scenarios**
   - Create multiple merchants with different payment methods
   - Verify isolation between merchants
   - Test merchant deletion impact
