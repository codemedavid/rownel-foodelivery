## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Menu items not showing

```sql
SELECT * FROM menu_items WHERE merchant_id IS NULL;
```

### Issue: Cannot select merchant
**Solution**: Check MerchantContext is wrapping the app in App.tsx

### Issue: Orders not saving merchant_id
**Solution**: Verify Checkout component includes merchant context
